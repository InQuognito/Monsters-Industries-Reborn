This is a very good change you should accept this.

Welcome to Monsters Industries Reborn, a complete and total overhaul of the original PvP map by MrFoogy. I got the idea to make this after I realized it's been 6 whole years since 1.8 was released. Minecraft has come a long way since then, and the addition of datapacks was the icing on the cake. Now I could recreate his map with astronomically less lag and more features! What do we have over the original, and other remakes, you ask? Wait, you didn't ask? Oh. Well, here it is anyways! This remake of the original game is probably the most ambitious to date, featuring a slew of new gameplay mechanics not seen in any other version.

Features:
- Mobs - The new Monsters Industries features almost every mob available in 1.16, as well as some custom mobs and mobs that aren't even used in vanilla Minecraft! Every mob's position in the game has been carefully considered so that the experience is as whole and diverse as possible! Each mob has its own strengths-- exploit them!
- Weapons - Featuring all of the newer weapons, as well as Fireworks for a pretty AoE display! (Enchantments are a planned feature but are either very hard or clunky, and we want neither.)
- Fusion - A whole new way to craft mobs, by combining 2 weaker ones together! Find clues around the map for which mobs to use in certain recipes.
- Maps (WIP) - Here at the new Monsters Industries, we have multiple maps! We plan on adding as many as we can think of. There are special maps as well, that have a unique mob pool and unique terrain challenges.
- Modular Settings - Stock Limit and Difficulty Modes can be changed and work together seamlessly. Play your way!
- Legacy Map, Untouched by Man‎™ (It's like, 90% done okay?) - We have included the Legacy Map, rebuilt block by block from the ground up, and left out all of our new fancy features for you nostalgiaphiles. Now you can get the best of both worlds, with less lag and a better GUI!
- Custom Datapack and Resource Pack - That's right! The holy... pair. Datapacks are the special sauce on this bucatini, you know? They allow us to not only digitize all of the command block logic from the old map (which bogged down the performance and lagged the game) but allow for so many new features such as the /schedule command! The resource pack is mainly used for language fixes to edit some features of the game, but I have big plans such as custom effects!

I try to update this map often with new features, feedback, and bug fixes! I will reiterate, all feedback is read and fully considered!
